--- DATA WRANGLING AND ANALYSIS FINAL ASSIGNMENT QUESTION #2
--- Write a query and table creation statement to make final_assignments_qa look like the final_assignments table.
--- If you discovered something missing in part 1, you may fill in the value with a place holder of the appropriate data type. 
--- let test_start_date be the unknown varialbe '2022-05-01 00:00:00' was used at the missing test start date
--- Here we rewrite the table to include thge test_start_time and ordery bu item_id, test_assignment, and test_number
